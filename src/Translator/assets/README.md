## Installation

This npm package is **reserved for advanced users** who want to decouple their JavaScript dependencies from their PHP dependencies (e.g., when building Docker images, running JavaScript-only pipelines, etc.).

We **strongly recommend not installing this package directly**, but instead  install the PHP package [symfony/ux-translator](https://packagist.org/packages/symfony/ux-translator) in your Symfony application with [Flex](https://github.com/symfony/flex) enabled.

If you still want to install this package directly, please make sure its version exactly matches [symfony/ux-translator](https://packagist.org/packages/symfony/ux-translator) PHP package version:
```shell
composer require symfony/ux-translator:2.23.0
npm add @symfony/ux-translator@2.23.0
