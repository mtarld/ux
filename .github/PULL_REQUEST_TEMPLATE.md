Replace this notice by a description of your feature/bugfix.
This will help reviewers and should be a good start for the documentation.

Additionally (see https://symfony.com/releases):
 - Always add tests and ensure they pass.
 - For new features, provide some code snippets to help understand usage.
 - Features and deprecations must be submitted against branch main.
 - Update/add documentation as required (we can help!)
 - Changelog entry should follow https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/conventions.html#writing-a-changelog-entry
 - Never break backward compatibility (see https://symfony.com/bc).
